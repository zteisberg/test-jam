This asset pack is CC0 like all of my asset packs, which means that you can use it for anything you want, commercial or not, without crediting me. I would love to see what projects you've used my assets in, however! Have fun!

I drew a bunch of tiles for a modern city top-down set. I ran out of ideas for tiles after a while. To be honest, I'm kinda getting tired of pixel art and there are so many other people out there who are making pixel art who are way better than me. However, if you want me to make another tile, you can suggest it to me in the comments!

If you have any questions about this tileset, don't hesitate to ask!

Includes:

293-ish tiles (I'm not sure how to count some tiles :|)
.png and .aseprite files
animated fence openings (the ones that open from the side look wonky, I don't really know how top down perspective works, shhhh)
one example image on how to use the tiles in the tileset
