This asset pack is CC0 like all of my asset packs, which means that you can use it for anything you want, commercial or not, without crediting me. I would love to see what projects you've used my assets in, however! Have fun!

Here are 32 pixel portraits for you guys to use! There are 16 female and 16 male. All portraits are 32 by 32 pixels and use the Rosy-42 pallete from Aseprite.

I made these to practice drawing people's faces. Some turned out better than others. I tried referencing real people's faces because I think I have a bad case of same-face-syndrome.

Includes:
individual images and one collected image
.aseprite and .png files
